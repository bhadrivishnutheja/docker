| Feature                    | **Docker**                                    | **Podman**                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daemon**                 | Uses a central daemon (`dockerd`)             | Daemonless, runs as user process                                |
| **Rootless**               | Rootless mode is available (not default)      | Designed for rootless operation                                 |
| **Docker CLI Compatible**  | Native CLI                                    | CLI compatible (`alias docker=podman`)                          |
| **Docker Compose Support** | Native support (`docker compose`)             | Uses external tools like `podman-compose` or `podman play kube` |
| **Systemd Integration**    | Limited                                       | Native systemd unit generation (`podman generate systemd`)      |
| **Kubernetes Support**     | Needs separate tools like `kompose` or `kind` | Can generate K8s YAML (`podman generate kube`)                  |
| **Container Images**       | Uses Docker Hub, OCI-compatible               | Also uses Docker Hub, OCI-compatible                            |
| **Swarm Support**          | Yes                                           | No swarm support                                                |
| **Security Model**         | Central daemon requires root access           | Each container runs as the calling user (more secure)           |


- Use Podman if you want improved security, systemd integration, or are working on rootless systems or Red Hat-based distros.

## Docker
-  Pros:
    Mature and widely adopted
    Rich ecosystem (Docker Hub, Docker Desktop, Docker Compose)
    Better tooling for beginners
- Cons:
    Docker daemon runs as root (security risk)
    Slightly heavier due to daemon

## Podman
- Pros:
    Daemonless = better security
    Rootless containers by default
    Better systemd & Kubernetes integration
    Drop-in replacement for Docker CLI
- Cons:
    Ecosystem and tooling less mature
    Compose support is not as seamless
    Smaller community (but growing)
